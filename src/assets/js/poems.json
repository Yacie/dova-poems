  "body": "I was half way on this journey\nWhen the bus had to pull over\nBy the roadside\nJust in front of one food court\n\nI needed a pizza\nThe best they had to offer\nSo I ordered the Chivi Style\nDouble cheese and double chicken\n\nI needed only to wait 6 minutes\nThen I would have it\nThe steaming medium\nAll for my good pleasure\n\nOnly after about a minute\nDid the bus driver start his engine\nAnd drove away\nLeaving me to the mercy of fate\nFor so I thought\n\nWhen I saw him drive away\nI forgot ‘bout the pizza I had ordered\nAnd as unheard of as it was\nA rock bun on the counter \nOffered itself to me\n‘I love you, you can have me instead’\n\nMy hunches told me I was getting lost\nBut even the lost are found wani\nSo I said, ‘Ok’ \n\nAnd the bun said\n‘Take me or I leave you’\n\n‘Hey! That's kind of pushy\nDon't you think?’\nI thought to myself\n‘And you better be good \nAs you are claiming.’\n\nSo as I ran out\nI grabbed the rock bun from the counter\nLeft a dollar \nAnd did not wait for my receipt\n\n‘Where do I find \nThe nearest car-hire services?’\nI asked an old man doing some landscaping\n\n‘Son,’\nHe began,\n\n‘Why don't u wait, \nOnly a few minutes,\nAnd give some thought to it, again.’\n\n‘Why should I?\nI retorted angrily\n\n‘Cause I know the driver’\nMy old man replied.\n\nSo I stood there\nLike a roman statue\nThinking of my next move\nOh, I was holding a bun\nI took a bite; \nDon't remember what it tasted like\nI must have looked heavenwards\nAs I munched\n\nAnd when I lowered my head\nThat's when I saw it\nWhat was really happening\nNdakazvishora amana.\n\nThe driver had gone to pump in\nSome more fuel\nWhilst we were being served\nFuck it, unotaurawo ka.\n\nBarely three minutes had passed\nWhen the rock bun started making some noises\n\n‘Hey bozo!\nThat's not how you eat me\nYou must really cherish me and\nButter me; left right and centre \nKana wanga usingandide wakanditorerei’\n\nKana nemi kuitawo here \nKuzvimbirwa ne rokobhanzi rakati ndiridye\nPaine vanhu;\nVehukama kunyangwe vatorwa?\nSo I gravely cautioned it,\n\nDon't ever, ever do that again, ever!\nNot even in private,\nUnless you mean for me\nTo feed you to the rats\n\nWhen I checked on the tills again,\nMy order was ready\nAnd awaiting my collection\n\nDamn!\nShe's was soo good\nSo steaming hot\nSo fucking delicious\n\nI was savouring my meal;\nThe sweet aroma was to my delight\nI imagined myself licking away all the juices\nAnd putting it in, nicely and slowly\n\nShe seemed to read my thoughts \nFor she made herself look her best\nTo kill me with appetite and desire\nI don't mind, you're mine\n\nThe rock bun then went berserk\nAmong other hostile and incessant\nVerbal attacks and harassment, \nSued me for not paying \nFor her bread bin\nWhen she was not a victim, \nBut the perpetrator.\n\nI had to see the merchandiser myself\nAnd advise him of the bad blood \nBetween me and his product\nAnd the inevitable death of whatever \nThe relationship was between me and it.\nHe scorned at me\n‘Look at you...’\n\nOkay never mind.\n\nWhen he failed to accept it\nThe token of divorce\nI threw it in his yard\nAnd walked away and never looked back\n\nHe had heard me\nThat was the point\nI conceded to the fact that\nI had to pay for the packaging \nThat I had shredded from his product\n\nHad the rock bun been modest\nPerhaps one day \nI was gonna write about\nThe ‘rock bun’ which the diner rejected…",
